    "summary": "In Christianity, anger is viewed as a complex emotion that can be both positive and negative. It is not inherently sinful but can become so if driven by pride, unproductive, or allowed to linger. The Bible approves of righteous indignation, as seen in God's anger towards sin and injustice. Followers are encouraged to acknowledge anger, address its causes, and respond with love and forgiveness rather than sin. This involves recognizing the primacy of God's sovereignty and trusting in His justice and love.",
    "ideas": "To manage anger biblically, Christians should first acknowledge their prideful or wrongful handling of anger as sin and confess this to God and others (Proverbs 28:13; 1 John 1:9). Christians are encouraged to reflect on God's sovereignty, trusting that He redeems all circumstances for good (Romans 8:28-29). They should also make room for God's wrath, understanding that His justice is linked to His love (Romans 12:19). Practicing self-control, forgiveness, and returning good for evil are key (Matthew 5:43-48; Romans 12:21). Finally, by prayer and reliance on the Holy Spirit, believers aim to transform their responses to anger into actions that glorify God.",

    "summary": "In Hinduism, anger is generally viewed as a negative emotion that can hinder spiritual growth. It is seen as a form of attachment or ignorance that clouds one's judgment and separates the individual from realizing the true nature of self and reality (Atman and Brahman). Followers are encouraged to manage anger through self-control, detachment, and wisdom, as exemplified by the concept of Akrodha (absence of anger). Practicing Akrodha involves transcending anger through spiritual disciplines, recognizing its illusory nature, and cultivating inner peace and harmony.",
    "ideas": "To manage anger in daily life from a Hindu perspective, individuals are advised to practice mindfulness, meditation, and self-control. Recognizing anger as a transient and illusory emotion helps in detaching oneself from its influence. Engaging in virtues such as compassion and non-violence (Ahimsa) also aids in reducing the propensity for anger. Additionally, understanding the cyclical nature of life and karma can help individuals accept challenges without getting angry, fostering a more serene and harmonious existence.",
