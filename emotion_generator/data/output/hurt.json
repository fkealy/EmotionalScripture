It is not seen as purely negative or positive but as a part of life's experiences that can arise from past actions. Followers are encouraged to approach hurt with acceptance and detachment, understanding that it can be an opportunity for spiritual growth and the fulfillment of past karmic debts. This perspective helps individuals to cope with hurt by viewing it as a temporary condition that does not affect the eternal Self (Atman).",
    "ideas": "Hindu teachings provide practical guidance on managing hurt by emphasizing acceptance and detachment. Practitioners are encouraged to focus on spiritual practices such as yoga and meditation to cultivate inner peace and understanding. The concept of ahimsa (non-violence) also plays a role in managing emotional states by promoting compassion and avoiding harm to oneself or others. Additionally, understanding the impermanence of emotions can help individuals navigate through feelings of hurt without becoming overwhelmed by them.",

While hurt cannot be avoided, it can be managed by shifting one's consciousness to a broader perspective, allowing emotions to move through and resolve into peace. This approach involves maintaining compassion and understanding, reflecting the concept of *khimaa* (often translated as forgiveness), which emphasizes letting go of animosity towards those who have caused harm.",

Additionally, the concept of *Sarbat Da Bhalla* (well-being for all) encourages Sikhs to maintain goodwill towards everyone, even in the face of hurt or injustice. This mindset aids in managing hurt by preventing it from escalating into anger or hatred.",
