Courage is seen as a virtue that is essential for living a faithful life, allowing Christians to stand firm in the face of adversity. Followers are encouraged to approach courage by relying on faith in God, whose power is made perfect in weakness.

  "buddhism": {
    "summary": "In Buddhism, bravery or courage is not explicitly defined as a negative or positive emotion in itself but is part of the cultivation of virtues needed for spiritual growth. The emotion of bravery arises from a deep understanding and acceptance of reality, including the non-existence of the self and the impermanence of all things. Bravery is about facing fears and emotions openly, transforming them into wisdom and compassion. Followers are encouraged to cultivate courage by embracing mindfulness, clarity, and the understanding that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence. By recognizing these principles, practitioners build resilience against negative emotions, including fear.",
    "ideas": "To manage and understand bravery in daily life, Buddhists are advised to follow the Eightfold Path and cultivate mindfulness (sati) and wisdom (prajña). They should acknowledge the impermanence and non-self nature of all phenomena, which allows them to confront fears and overcome them through compassion and understanding. Meditation and mindfulness practice help in developing a calm and reflective mind, enabling practitioners to face challenges with courage. This approach transforms ordinary bravery into spiritual courage, characterized by fearlessness and wisdom.",
