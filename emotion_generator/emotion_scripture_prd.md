### Title:  
**Script Generator for Emotion-Based Scripture Wheel (Multi-Religion)**

---

## üß© Overview

This script uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate structured, validated JSON data that links emotions to relevant scriptures from **Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, and Sikhism**. It employs a two-stage process: generation and verification.

Each emotion will be tied to quotes from each religion, with each quote containing its own set of descriptive tags for deeper insight and future filtering.

---

## ‚úÖ 0. Target Emotions

The script will run for each of the following 34 emotions:

```json
[
  "Accepted", "Valued", "Respected", "Powerful", "Hopeful", "Brave",
  "Excited", "Grateful", "Caring", "Creative", "Curious", "Affectionate",
  "Guilty", "Ashamed", "Excluded", "Embarrassed", "Annoyed", "Jealous",
  "Bored", "Overwhelmed", "Powerless", "Anxious", "Disappointed", "Hurt",
  "Lonely", "Loved", "Sad", "Scared", "Angry", "Playful", "Happy",
  "Confident"
]
```

Each emotion will have corresponding data in the `emotionData.ts` file with structured scriptures and quotes across the 5 major religions.

---

## üéØ Goals

- Create structured, validated data connecting emotions to scriptural insights across major religions
- Include comprehensive tagging system for quotes to enable rich filtering and discovery
