    "summary": "In Hinduism, the emotion of feeling overwhelmed is typically viewed through the lens of suffering and mental turmoil, which are considered forms of *dukha* or distress. This state is often seen as an opportunity for spiritual growth rather than a negative emotion to be avoided outright. Hindu teachings suggest that followers should approach this emotion by cultivating detachment (*vairagya*), understanding the impermanence of emotions, and aligning with one’s life purpose (*dharma*). By recognizing that emotions are transient and not identifying with them, individuals can manage feelings of overwhelm effectively, leading to a more balanced and peaceful life.",
    "ideas": "To manage and understand the emotion of feeling overwhelmed, Hinduism offers several practical teachings: **Detachment** from desires and outcomes helps reduce emotional turbulence. **Understanding the impermanence of emotions** allows individuals to view them as transient states rather than defining characteristics. **Focusing on one's dharma**, or life purpose, provides direction and meaning, reducing feelings of being overwhelmed. Additionally, practices like meditation and mindfulness can help cultivate equanimity and emotional resilience.",
