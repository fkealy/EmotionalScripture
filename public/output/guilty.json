They should distinguish between true guilt that leads to repentance and false guilt that fosters self-condemnation. Daily guidance involves prayer, focusing on God's grace and mercy, and understanding that Jesus's sacrifice cleanses all sin. Believers should also engage in activities that reflect God's love and forgiveness, such as service to others and participation in community life.",
