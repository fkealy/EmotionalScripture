    "summary": "In Christianity, jealousy is viewed as a complex emotion with both righteous and sinful forms. Righteous jealousy, such as God's jealousy, is rooted in love and commitment, while sinful jealousy stems from insecurity or selfishness. Followers are encouraged to approach jealousy by recognizing its sources, cultivating gratitude, contentment, and trust in God's provision. Managing jealousy involves self-reflection, prayer, and aligning one's heart with godly virtues like love and kindness.",
    "ideas": "Practically, Christians should manage jealousy through self-reflection, recognizing its causes, and praying to address these emotions. Cultivating gratitude and contentment helps reduce jealousy by focusing on the blessings received rather than comparing oneself to others. Embracing a life of service and love helps shift the focus from personal desires to God's guidance, thereby transforming potentially destructive emotions into constructive ones. Trusting in God's sovereignty and grace is crucial for overcoming jealousy rooted in insecurity or fear.",

It is seen as an obstacle to cultivating love, compassion, and wisdom. Followers are encouraged to address jealousy through practices like sympathetic joy (mudita) and cultivating self-acceptance, recognizing that happiness and success of others do not diminish one's own worth. This approach helps in transforming jealousy into a positive mindset by embracing and rejoicing in others' success.",

They also practice self-acceptance and self-reflection to recognize the root causes of jealousy, such as insecurity or a sense of inadequacy. Practical guidance includes recognizing the harm caused by jealousy, such as damaging relationships and perpetuating suffering, and replacing it with love and compassion for all beings.",

    "summary": "In Hinduism, jealousy (or *mātsarya*) is viewed as a negative emotion that arises from intolerance towards others' excellence. It is considered one of the six internal enemies and is harmful as it leads individuals to compare themselves unfavorably with others. To manage jealousy, Hindus are advised to cultivate a mindset of acceptance and compassion, recognizing the unique qualities and achievements of others without resentment. The concept of *pratipakṣa-bhāvanā* suggests that by acknowledging and replacing jealousy with positive thoughts, one can overcome it.",
    "ideas": "Key teachings in Hinduism suggest that followers should avoid unhealthy comparisons and focus on self-improvement rather than pulling others down. In spiritual contexts, such as *bhakti*, jealousy is seen as a barrier to genuine devotion and spiritual growth. Practitioners are encouraged to rejoice in the success of others and understand that each individual's prosperity is a result of their past actions (*karma*). This understanding helps in overcoming envy by focusing on one's own spiritual journey rather than comparing with others.",

  "islam": {
    "summary": "In Islam, jealousy is primarily viewed as a negative emotion. It is considered haram when it involves wishing harm to others or results in actions that manifest envy or resentment. However, followers can approach it as a natural feeling that must be controlled and managed through faith and self-reflection. They should focus on gratitude for what Allah has provided and avoid comparing themselves to others. The goal is to prevent jealousy from becoming an actionable sin by not acting upon it and instead cultivating a mindset of contentment and positive envy (ghibtah), which involves wishing to possess similar blessings without wishing harm to others.",
    "ideas": "To manage jealousy in daily life, Muslims are advised to practice gratitude, reflect on those who have less, and engage in dua (prayer) for guidance and peace. They can also focus on building good deeds and seeking refuge in Allah from the accursed shaytan. Emotional balance and self-control are key to transforming jealousy into a positive force, such as through learning from others' successes and emulating their virtues without envy. The Islamic concept of justice and fairness also emphasizes treating all individuals with kindness and respect, regardless of their possessions or status.",
