    "ideas": "Practically, Christians manage shame by recognizing it as a natural consequence of sin but not allowing it to define their identity. They should approach shame with self-awareness and humility, knowing God values them enough to offer redemption. The key teachings emphasize understanding shame's role in revealing personal shortcomings, seeking forgiveness, and embracing the love of God. In daily life, believers can manage shame by focusing on their identity in Christ, practicing acts of repentance, and engaging in religious routines that provide a sense of peace and reconciliation.",
