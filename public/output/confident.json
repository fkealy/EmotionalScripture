This involves trusting in God's sovereignty and faithfulness, as seen in scripture. Believers are encouraged to cultivate God-confidence by understanding God's character, praying for guidance, and reflecting on past experiences of God's intervention. Additionally, scripture advises believers to guard against negative influences that can erode confidence, such as Satan's accusations or worldly fears. By focusing on spiritual truth and divine reassurance, believers can overcome self-doubt and achieve a more steadfast confidence in their daily lives.",
